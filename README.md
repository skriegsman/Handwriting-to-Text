# Picture-to-Braille

* ## Inspiration

* ## What it does
  * This program will take a picture input of a paper wether it be mail, prescription medicine bottle, text book page for school, etc. and return the text it finds as braille.
  * This can be a great resource to blind students learning in an environment that isnt equipped to teach them as braille printers are often expensive and difficult to use
* ## How we built it
  *  
* ## Challenges we ran into

* ## Accomplishments that we're proud of

* ## What we learned

* ## What's next for Picture-to-Braille
